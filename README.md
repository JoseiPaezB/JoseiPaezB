### Hi there, Im Jose IgnacioðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying my third year in Tecnologico de Monterrey, the career of engineering in computer science. 

I am very passionate about programming and exploring each language that I am learning. I recognize myself as a strong and frequent user of Python, Node.JS, JavaScript and C++. 

Currently I work with a department of my university where I mostly help with organizing data and extracting data of recent graduated students. 

I'm currently imporving my backend development skills mostly with databases and APIs. 

I love to write and read poetry about life and feelings, read sci-fi or dystopian books, listen and discover new music, watch movies, gaming and doing all type of activities like hitting the gym, running, climbing and drawing.
