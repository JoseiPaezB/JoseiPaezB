### Hi, Im Jose IgnacioðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying my second year in Tecnologico de Monterrey, the career of engineering in computer science. 

I am very passionate about programming and exploring each language that I am learning. I recognize myself as a strong and frequent user of python and C++ mostly. 

Currently I work with a department of my university where I mostly help with organizing data and extracting data of recent graduated students. 

I'm currently learning backend development mostly with databases and APIs. DBeaver is currently my favorite platform to work on this. 

I love to write poetry about life and feelings, reading sci-fi or dystopian books, listening and discovering new music, watching movies, gaming and doing outdoor activities like running, hiking and surfing.
